            <h4>Bug Bounties</h4>
            <p>During my free time, I have been learning Web Hacking and have gotten involved in Bug Bounty programs</p>
            <p>Here are the Bug Bounty programs that I am currently involved in:</p>

            <a href="https://bugcrowd.com/danteswrath">BugCrowd</a>
          <h5>Skills learned while bug hunting</h5>
          <div class="projectlist">
          <ul>
              <li>Learned how to properly use recon tools, such as NMAP, Subfinder, Naabu, httpx, etc</li>
              <li>Learned how to use the output from Subfinder and scan subdomains using nmap and httpx to verify live hosts and open ports</li>
              <li>I have written a bash script to automate most of the tools I use and I continue to polish my script for better automation</li>
              <li>Learned how to use other tools such as Burp Suite, OWASP ZAP, and a new web proxy called Caido</li>
              <li>Have also learned how to use web vulnerabliilty scanners such as, Nikto and Nuclei</li>
              <li>I have also used fuzzing tools such as ffuf and dirsearch</li>
              <li>I have also learned what to look for to test for possible vulnerablities in websites, such as areas where I can inject SQL or perform an XSS attack.</li>
              <li>I've learned to look for open redirects, CORS, XXE, IDOR, and more</li>
          </ul>
          </div>
          <p>I have yet to find and report vulnerabliities in these programs, however I have not stopped learning and improving my skills to one day find my first vulnerability</p>
